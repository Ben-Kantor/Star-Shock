This is a step by step guide to building a character for the Star-Shock TTRPG. You should have access to all relevant documents and a character sheet, ideally printed out.  This guide will use page numbers with arrows pointing to where on the character sheet a field is to make it easy to find. Write with a pencil or erasable pen, and make sure your writing is legible for yourself and others. Start by putting your name or initials on the sheet (p1, ↗).
### 0. Learn The Setting
Before building a character, it's important you get a basic understanding of the setting and tone of the world. First read the game's [Read-me](/Readme.md), plus the overview of the starting location, by default [Paragon City](Paragon%20City.md). Then browse through other setting documents until you feel you are ready. 
### 1. Pick Backgrounds
Take a look through [Backgrounds](https://github.com/Ben-Kantor/Star-Shock/blob/3b373c236c1026822b27c087b96905cbd1aafcc1/Player%20Resources/Backgrounds.md) and pick two that appeal to you. This is the most important choice in character creating, and will inform all future decisions so think carefully. If you want, you can consult your GM about building a custom background or modifying an existing one, but you should use at least one vanilla one. Also talk to other players and hear what characters they are making, to make sure yours fits into the party. Once you have chosen two different backgrounds, write them down on your sheet (p1. ↑), then copy over any benefits they give you in skills (p2, ↖), features (p2, ←), and starting items in your inventory (p1, ↓).

Copy any contacts (p1, ←) you gained, with the number of stars in the top right, and their occupation in the bottom box. You may then choose to give them a name (top row), or leave it blank for now. In the second row, for location, you can choose to either put your starting location or leave it blank for the contact to be introduced at another location later in the story. When they are filled in they will need a lot of specification. For instance, if you are granted a criminal contact, you will need to choose whether they are a smuggler, thief, fence, or something else.
### 2. Determine Attributes and Skills
Here you will determine the main mechanical strengths and weaknesses of your character. For this part its best to co-ordinate with other players to make sure you have a well-balanced party.

Now, divide up 7 points between the four attributes in the game, with no value above 3.  Keep in mind that putting a 0 in any attribute will leave you with serious a weakness and vulnerability to certain attacks. Enter these attributes on your sheet (p2, ↑). 

- **Strength**: Physical power and endurance, for melee combat and brute force tasks.
- **Dexterity**: Agility, precision, and speed, for ranged combat, stealth, and finesse-based actions.
- **Intellect**: Mental acuity, problem-solving, and technical skills, for problem-solving and knowledge.
- **Presence**: Charisma, influence, and force of personality, for social interactions and tests of willpower.

See [Skills & Attributes](/Player%20Resources/Skills%20&%20Attributes.md) for more details on what each skill and attribute represents.

You will get most of your skills from your [Backgrounds](./Backgrounds.md), which will sometimes grant fixed skills and sometimes let you choose from within a category. Think about skills that will contribute to the persona of a character you are working on. Enter these on your sheet (p2, ←).

| {{Engineering}}  | {{Academic}}  | {{High-Life}} | {{Low-Life}} | {{Explorer}} |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| {Computators}    | {Physics}     | {Investigate} | {Subtlety}   | {Medicate}   |
| {Robotics}       | {Chemistry}   | {Persuade}    | {Deceive}    | {Move}       |
| {Mechanics}      | {Lore}        | {Insight}     | {Stealth}    | {Survival}   |
| {Energy Systems} | {Biology}     | {Authority}   | {Streetwise} | {Navigate}   |
| {Comms}          | {Planetology} | {Charm}       | {Intimidate} | {Track}      |
| {Spacecrafts}    | {Xenology}    | {Negotiate}   | {Recon}      | Nature}      |
### 3. Write Descriptions
There are two boxes on your character sheet for Personality and Appearance (p1, ↑). You can choose to write a more detailed description for either of these, but at a minimum you should have three adjectives/descriptions for each. If you have more to add there's space in the notes box (p1, ↙).

Now you can fill out the four small boxes about your character's identity (p1, ↗).

- **Pronouns**: These are also a symbol of your character's gender identity here.
	- Trans and non-binary are common and well accepted, especially among humans.
	- Playing a character with a gender identity similar to your own is easier for role-playing and recommended for those newer to the hobby.
- **Species**: This should be human unless you are half-alien with a background.
	- You can also choose to be half-alien just for flavor, but with no mechanical benefits. (Half-alien biology is inconsistent between individuals)
- **From**: Where the character is from.
	- Options include: Paragon City, any location on Earth, another Lunar Colony, a spaceship or station, or the Meteor Belt.
- **Title**: Position in the Human Interplanetary Fleet or any organized structure.
	- Leave blank for now.

You may also choose to make a basic drawing of your character, on the body template (p1, ↙). This will primarily be used later for tracking wounds and bodily enhancements.
### 4. Choose a Name
Next you will need to choose a name for your character (p1, ↑).

For forename, here are some resources to consider:
- [Colonial Era Names](https://nameberry.com/list/1031/colonial-names-from-the-1700s)
- [Mid-Century Names](https://nameberry.com/list/426/midcentury-baby-names)
- [Futuristic Sounding Names](https://momlovesbest.com/futuristic-baby-names)

You may also choose a nickname to go by instead or in addition, if so put it in quotes.

Surnames are trickier, but less important, [this list](https://listophile.com/names/last/vintage/) is decent, but it can also work well to come up with a name on your own. To do so start with a random series of sounds and slowly work it in your mouth, cleaning up rough parts and changing it until it sounds good. This method can of course be used for forenames as well.

You can also add a middle initial to improve the sound of your full name.
### 5. Determine Money and Buy Starting Items
Add your bank account under accounts (p1, ↘).
- Holder: *The Planetary Reserve*
- Unit: ₮ [(*TSI*)](/Setting/Currencies.md#TSI)
- Value: Roll 3d6 x 10 (don't cheat)

You may then buy up to two different Items from [Basic Items](/Items/Basic%20Items.md) page (and multiples if you like), and up to one weapon from the [Weapons](/Items/Weapons.md) page. Add these to the inventory section (p1, ↓), and also add the weapon to the items section (p2, |). For help with filling in the item boxes see the [Checks](/Rules/Checks.md#Weapons) section on weapons.

Once you are done buying starting items, add an additional ₮25 to your account, as starting money that cannot be spent before the game.
### 6. Miscellaneous Tasks
Just a few more things to fill out:
- Put 0 in both spent and total [XP](XP.md) (p1, →).
- For each [Resistance](/Rules/Combat.md#Resistances) (p2, →), put 7 plus your value in the associated attribute, plus any [Armor](/Rules/Checks.md#Armor) bonuses.
- Put a 0 in [Damage Taken](/Rules/Combat.md#Damage%20Taken) and [Luck Points](/Rules/Mechanics.md#Luck%20Points) (p2, ↘).
### 7. Talk to Your GM
Give your GM a chance to look over your sheet to make sure everything is filled out correctly. They might ask you questions about your character to help understand them, or suggest changes to make sure they fit the setting and are fun to play. Between sessions you should leave your sheet with your GM so they can use it to plan the story, but they won't change anything.
