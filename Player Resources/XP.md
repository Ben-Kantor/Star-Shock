## Gaining XP
Characters should receive approximately two points of XP for every hour of gameplay, every time they complete a major challenge or several minor challenges. This can then be added to the total section of the XP box on their character sheet. Tthe GM will reward this XP at the end of a session, rather than throughout it.
## Spending XP
Unlike other games, XP that is spent to gain a mechanical advantage must have an in-world explanation, rather that characters suddenly gaining new abilities. This usually takes the form of a character practicing something, receiving training, or otherwise receiving the improvement. Most which you spend XP will take one shift, spend practicing, training, or otherwise. After doing this, mark down how much was spent where on the **Spent XP** table on the character sheet.
#### Skills
Gaining a new skill costs 3 XP, and takes one shift.
#### Item Trainings
Spend 5 XP and a shift and choose a weapon, gain a +1 bonus on attacks made using that weapon. Some advanced items require training to use at all. You can also replace one training with another by spending a shift and 1 XP.
#### Leveled Features
Each set of leveled features will have three levels, each of which must be bought in order. Each level costs 5 XP and takes one shift to train. There are two types:
- [Psionics](/Player%20Resources/Psionics.md) - Supernatural abilities through powerful mental focus.
- [Cybernetics](/Player%20Resources/Cybernetics.md) - Technologic enhancements to the user's body.
#### Emergency Luck
XP can also be spent in the same way as Luck points, when this is done, note it down under the XP usage table.
#### Adding Contacts
Contacts can be added at the (◆◇◇) level for 3 XP, this represents a contact your character had previously but is only now choosing to use.
#### Advancements
Can be purchases from the [Advancements](./Advancements.md) page, take one shift to train.
