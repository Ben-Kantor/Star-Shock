All psionic features cost 5 XP to unlock. To train an ability, a character must spend a shift and make a Prs check against a difficulty of 10 + the level of feature they are attempting to gain. On a success, they gain the ability. On a failure, they gain a +1 bonus toward their next attempt, which can stack.

When making a psionics check against a character, roll a Prs check against a difficulty equal to their Prs resistance. If you fail any psionics check, you take 1 damage point.
- Targets are vaguely aware that psionics were used unless your roll exceeded the check difficulty by at least 1, or you spend a luck point to counter this awareness.
- If you attempt a psionics check against a target (with or without a roll), you cannot do so again with the same target and ability until you rest.
- Unless otherwise stated, all psionic abilities have a range of 10m.
- Only one continuous psionic ability can be active at a time; it ends if you take 3 or more damage.
- If attempting to push the limits of an ability (e.g., range, weight), a Prs check may be required, or you may take a -1 penalty on a psionics check.
