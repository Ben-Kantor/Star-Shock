Expert items are a type of armor, weapons, or other utility items that require training to use. Each one requires 5 XP to train, and then it can be added to the training section on the character sheet (see the [XP](/Player%20Resources/XP.md#Expert%20Items) page for more information). Expert items do not have a value, and the process of obtaining them must be linked to the story. If a character particularly wants one, they will have to seek out a seller or steal one.
