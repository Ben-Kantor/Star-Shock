## History
The Meteor Belt, marks the farthest edge of the inner solar system, and is controlled not by one body but by a mass of different houses. After the Martian Truce was signed in 1960 civilian human ships were allowed out past Mars, and quickly human entrepreneurs began to claim the asteroids, except for those occupied by the outer planets. Quickly the entire belt was split between the many "Star Barons", who formed the various "Star Houses". While it began with just humans, many Martians, some Venusians, and even some Saturnians took shares of the belt and established their own houses. Every asteroid in the belt is now either occupied or has some form of automatic sentinel to hold the claim for it's owner, even if that defence system is only a single robot, patrolling the surface. 
## Life on the Belt
Key resources such as air and water are controlled by the houses and are sold to citizens. The living conditions tend to be poor so most workers are either robots or humans from earth who have a 5-year work contract. Habitats are often built inside asteroids, or as long cylinders jutting out of them.
