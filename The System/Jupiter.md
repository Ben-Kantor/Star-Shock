### Jovians
Jovians are fungal colony creatures, green or brown in color, around 1.5-2m in diameter with tendrils reaching out. They evolved in the clouds of Jupiter, where various plants and other lifeforms float. They live for thousands of years, and look down on all other lifeforms. When transliterated, the jovian language contains long words made up of only the following letters: AEOUWH.

When forced to visit the surface of other planets, they live in enormous slug-like tanks, 4m tall with a curved glass sphere in front, and a long tail trailing 10m behind, all propelled by 15cm mechanical legs. Jovian spacecraft are enormous worm-like structures, some over 15km long.
