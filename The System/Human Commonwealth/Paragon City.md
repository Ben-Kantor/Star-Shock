The largest extra-terrestrial human city, Paragon City, is located on the northern pole of the moon. It has a population of just under 1 million humans, as well as roughly 1000 extra-terrestrials. The upper city is built in a kilometer-tall spire made out of rough glass still containing specks of regolith, split up into floors about 200 meters across. Because the city is built on the lunar pole, there is always sunlight, but the angle changes in cycles of 30 days (one "lunar month"). The enormous Lunar shipyards and the Human Interplanetary Force Flagship HWS Thunderhead are visible from the ground, hovering about 10 kilometers above, held by enormous electromagnets.

A the top of the tower is a thin spire called the Lunar Aerie, which is the command center for the Interplanetary Force of the Human Commonwealth. At the top an enormous Jacobs ladder several kilometers tall sends off messages to human ships as far out as Neptune. Landing pads are located around it in pairs of three alternating by angle, with various small but elaborate ships. The bottom few floors are open to anyone, but security increases the higher you go.

The center of the spire has a set of open front elevators constantly moving up and down, that can be stepped on and off freely. There are also pneumatic tubes with ports that let you send an item to any floor, or directly to some locations. There is a road in a spiralized triple helix near the edge of the tower, on which people drive in open-top rovers. The three towers are connected by cable cars, which cost ₮1 per trip. The top of each spire is a spacepad atop a hangar floor, for luxury vehicles and civilian transports alike. 

The lower floors, in partial shade from the terrain and even below it, are filled with industrial workshops and lower-class residences. Floors are as close together as 5m, and light is brought in with fiber optic cables. Structures are made of regolith panels, rough marbled gray stone, and roads are more like hallways. Closer to the base of the spire a constant vibration can be felt it is constantly mined deeper into the ground, and forges melt the regolith to produce all forms of goods. Luminescent graffitti can be seen in places, sometimes promising revolution of various forms, sometimes just being annoying.

The middle floors, taking up half of the space, contain shops, restaurants, and luxury apartments, with floors about 15m apart. The streets between buildings are made of a gray marbled material called LunaLite. Buildings are made out of bricks from this same substances as well as painted corrugated steel, and plastic. Water, plasma, and fresh air run through glass pipes visible in many places outside, and sewage runs through a tinted pipe. Neon signs are often connected directly to the plasma line, in multi-floor markets built out of mesh. Buildings on the edge of the spires, outside the road, have bubble balconies.

The upper floors are owned by wealthy businesses, including some extra-terrestrial businesses and embassies. There are leisure areas here, many of which are available to the to the lower floor residents for a small fee, but some of which are private. Some include levitating plant baskets, and even exotic zoos. There are many luxury hotels and condos and private offices, with the most fancy ones located at the edge of the spire with a view.
