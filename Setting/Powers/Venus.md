Venus was the second planet to make contact with Earth and the first to establish formal diplomatic relations. To this day, it remains the closest ally of the Human Commonwealth. Venusians have green, mossy skin, and longer limbs than Humans. They can move quickly and are good at climbing. Venusians are often considered kind and welcoming by humans, and have an extensive diplomatic campaign making them allies across the system.
## Planetology
Venus, shrouded in thick, reflective clouds, hides a vibrant and alien ecosystem beneath its dense, sweltering atmosphere. The surface is dominated by a sprawling, hot jungle teeming with unique flora and fauna. Near the equator, high temperatures create an environment ideal for the Venusians. A few less humid areas near the equator sometimes have savannas instead of jungles, and closer to the poles there are biomes with more mild temperatures.
## Space Travel
Space launches from Venus are rare due to its dense atmosphere and high gravity. Venusian spacecraft, designed with this in mind, operate like hybrid blimps and rockets. They float to the upper atmosphere, before igniting rocket engines to escape into orbit. Most Venusian launches are reserved for diplomatic missions, with ambassadors representing Venus throughout the solar system.
## Cities
Venusian cities are a seamless blend of architecture and nature, built to coexist with the planet's dense vegetation. Buildings often feature channels and hollow walls designed for plants to grow through, creating living, breathing structures. Over time, some buildings become so overgrown that the plant life becomes an essential part of their structural integrity. This symbiosis reflects Venusian culture's deep respect for and reliance on their planet's unique ecosystem. The Aphrodite Jungle is home to the various clustered cities, connected by vacuum trains, that together make up the Venusian captial. The only official spaceport is on the mountain of Alta Regio.
## Plants
Venusian plants feed on warmth, making them cool to the touch. 
#### Tuberoot
A plant made of gnarled green tubes, which suck in or push out air. Are able to transform CO2 into oxygen at incredible rates. These are grown on almost all human spacecraft, and can cause outbreaks of Venusian Vine.
#### Venusian Vine
A green fibourous plant that looks like it's bundled together. Twists and moves of its own accord when perturbed and is strong enough to break bones. 
#### Wormoss
A dense, fuzzy green moss which grows baloon-like flowers filled with hallucinogenic spores. Sometimes cultivated for this purpose. "Worm" is a popular illegal drug in the Human Commonwealth, taken in various forms.
#### Glowfruit
Round, bulbous blue fruit that emit a faint glow.
#### Spice Pods
Orange pea-pod shaped fruits that contain a powerful mix of flavors.
