### Intro
House Navarium operates the largest fleet of mobile shipyards in the solar system, specializing in spacecraft construction, refurbishment, and trade. Their entire civilization lives aboard massive carrier vessels and shipyards. They maintain a profitable business repairing and upgrading ships for other Houses while building their own vessels, often from the materials of old decommissioned ships which they buy for cheap.

Their mobile shipyards travel in convoys around the belt, dipping into the inner solar system every few years to buy old ships from Earth and Mars and resell their refurbished ones. This mobility lets them capitalize on local market demands and avoid political entanglements. Many of their people never set foot on a planet or asteroid, having lived their entire lives in space. They have many workshops in large cities on other planets, which are known for being high-end. All of their workshops are held at 0 gravity, which is how their engineers prefer to work.
### Insignia
The House Navarium insignia depicts a stylized spacecraft emerging from dock struts, with trailing energy lines behind it. The design is often projected in blue holographic light and appears on all their vessels and documentation.
### Settlements
Rather than a fixed base, House Navarium's population is distributed across their "Wandering Fleet" - dozens of enormous carrier ships that serve as mobile cities and construction yards. Each carrier is a self-contained community with multiple construction/repair bays for simultaneous ship projects.

The flagship of their fleet is the "Skywalker", a 5km long carrier ship (the largest mobile spacecraft in the system) which houses their leadership. It features:
- The largest zero-gravity construction bay in the solar system
- A prestigious engineering academy
- Hydroponic gardens providing food for the fleet
- A museum of historical spacecraft and components
- Trading floors where deals are negotiated
- The central computator network that coordinates fleet movements
### Trade Practices
The House maintains a complex network of:
- Salvage operations that acquire derelict vessels
- Refurbishment centers that modernize old ships
- Testing facilities for experimental modifications
- Material recycling stations
- Permanent workshops in major cities
- Mobile repair teams that can be dispatched to clients
### Leaders
The House is governed by the Shipwright Union, with representatives from engineering, trade, and fleet operations. The current President is Venna Navarium, an older woman who emigrated from Earth as a child. Leadership positions are earned through demonstration of knowledge and skill, with the most intelligent receiving leadership positions.

The Union maintains strict quality control over all operations through a system of master engineers who must approve all major projects. These masters are known for their distinctive void-suits decorated with complex geometric patterns indicating their specialties. They are often brought in to consult on large spacecraft construction projects undertaken by other worlds.
