### Intro
House Colebarum controls the largest mining operations in the Belt, with massive automated drilling rigs that bore through asteroids extracting precious metals and rare minerals. Their specialty is tungsten mining, which they refine into Zenth coins and sell to other Houses. They are also the lead supplier of gold, iron, silver, and other metals.

House Colebarum maintains strict control over their mining operations through a complex system of contracts and licenses. They employ thousands of independent prospectors who scout for new deposits, but maintain their monopoly by requiring all findings to be reported to the House. Their mining rights are enforced by a fleet of heavily armed patrol ships. Most of their menial workers are from Earth who work on 5-year terms.
### Insignia
The House Colebarum insignia shows a pickaxe crossed with a drill, surrounded by a gear. The entire design is made of interlocking tungsten pieces. The insignia is stamped into all their mining equipment and ships, and a simplified version is used to mark their Zenth coins.
### Settlements
Their primary base is the hollowed-out asteroid Vesta, which they've transformed into a vast mining complex. The interior is a maze of tunnels, processing facilities, and storage vaults. Enormous drilling platforms extend from the surface, which smaller asteroids are attached too in order to be drilled out. The interior is cramped and uses arti-grav flooring. The largest ever fusion ring around the outside of the asteroid produces a huge amount of energy.

The lower levels contain the refineries and forges where raw ore is processed into pure metals. Massive storage vaults hold their reserves of precious metals and Zenth coins. The middle levels house workshops where mining equipment is manufactured and repaired. The upper levels contain living quarters for workers and House officials, featuring the Star-Burger franchise and other amenities from Earth.
### Technology
House Colebarum uses highly advanced mining technology, including:
- Plasma drills that can cut through solid rock
- Automated sorting systems that can identify valuable minerals
- Specialized void-suits with built-in mineral scanners
- Cargo-bots programmed for ore transportation
- Anti-grav platforms for moving heavy equipment and piles of ores
- Ore separators that vaporize metals and distill them.
### Leaders
The House is led by the Colebarum Mining Council, made up various industry leaders. The current High Administrator is Petra Colebarum, who earned her position by discovering the largest tungsten deposit in Belt history, in a location that has not been revealed. The Council maintains strict control through the Mining Guild, which trains and licenses all miners in the belt. They also operate their own security force, equipped with tungsten-lined armor and specialized mining equipment modified for combat use.
