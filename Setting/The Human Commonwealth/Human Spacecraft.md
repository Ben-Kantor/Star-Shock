## Stations
The largest deep-space station built by the Commonwealth is Ticonderoga Stations, a hollow hexagon 1km wide at the L2 Lagrange point just outside of Earth's orbit. It is the central military outpost, and is slowly being disarmed and refitted as a public station for voidsteaders.
## Spaceships
Commonwealth spaceships tend to look like large rectangular prisms with flattened edges bolted together. They are compartmentalized to survive even catastrophic failures. Many are repurposed military ships from the Martian Wars.
## Ascension II
A human space elevator built in Brazil out of Carbon Nanotubes after Ascension I was destroyed in a Martian attack. Carries humans, goods, and small craft into high orbit, saving fuel costs and effort. At the top there is a large civilian station of the same name, including a giant gravity ring around the elevator, from before the discovery of arti-grav.
## Lunar Shipyards
An enormous complex for the construction and docking of ships above Paragon City. Held in place 10k over the city, it consists of a network of tubes, which have gravity plating on multiple sides. Several pays are used for building and repairing large ships, but there are many docking ports of hundreds of ships at a time. Shuttles regularly run between it and Paragon City.
## Human Interplanetary Force
The space-navy of the commonwealth is called the Human Interplanetary Force. They maintain several hundred large vessels for their defence, as well as scientific and diplomatic missions. 
#### Command Structure
Ranks are descending in power level, all ranks can order those beneath them, and can promote up to the rank directly beneath them. Italicized ranks indicate a field specialist. The fields include, but are not limited to, Security, Science, Engineering, Medicine, Communications, and Piloting. Specialists have equal rank to their counterparts with general/command roles, but are focused on a particular field.

These ranks are part of the administrative structure of the human commonwealth:
- The Commonwealth Congress Standing Committee
- The Commonwealth Congress and Director of the Office of Defence
These ranks are Officers of the HIF:
- Admiral
- Captain, *Director\** (There are only 1-2 directors per specialty)
- Commander\*\*, *Chief Officer* (Smaller ships are often run by a commander instead of a captain.)
- Ensign, *Officer\*\*\** (Technically also ensigns, but just referred to as "\<specialty\> officer".)
These ranks are trainees:
- Cadet

Any civilian can enlist as a Cadet with no formal training, and will remain at that rank until promoted to ensign.
