The Human Commonwealth is the ruling body over much of the Earth and the Moon, and is the largest human government. It is divided into 1297 subsectors, each with 10-20 members, elected in a shared election. Subsectors are either a large city or a group of smaller cities and or rural area. These subsectoral councils then elect an executive council for their region, with 8-12 members, each with a different role (e.g., defence, commerce, innovation), one of whom is internally selected as chair. Titles vary between the 6 sectors: Extra-Terra, America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania. All executive council members are also part of the Commonwealth Congress, along with some directors of governmental offices. The congress elects office directors for various specialized offices, as well electing a standing committee who are kept secret for their safety, who set the agenda for meetings and plan budgets. There are about 30 offices covering many aspects of society.

All citizens of the commonwealth have an identification chip implanted in their wrists at birth, to identify them, which they can use to scan for entrance into secure buildings. Some indigenous nations, pacific islands, and rural communities have elected not to join the commonwealth. The commonwealth is highly bureaucratic, and is slow to adopt new technologies with an extensive safety approval process. 

Enforcement is usually carried out by order-keepers, colloquially called the "blues" for their uniforms. They mostly bring a sense of justice and hand out traffic and other municipal violations, but most serious anti-criminal activity is done using hired mercenaries. The Human Commonwealth operates a space-fleet called the Human Interplanetary Fleet or HIF.

The Commonwealth was formed in 1973 during the Martian Wars, to mount an opposition to the [Red Union](The%20Red%20Union.md).
