### Intro
Despite being one of the smaller houses, House Scalerium (scale-reeum) is extremely wealthy. This is due to their near-monopoly of the supply for cybernetic components. They also design the vast majority of enhancements, and sell the plans. The Martian government has repeatedly accused them of stealing technologies, and their is still a level of animosity between the two worlds.

For House Scalerium the ultimate goal is to be free of the shackles of human bodies. Many high level leaders have replaced the majority of their body with cybernetic components, and appear as three meter tall robots. Some even claim to have managed to removed the last of their flesh and become completely mechanical.
### Insignia
The primary insignia of house Scalerium is two humanoid heads rotated 180 degrees from each other, with wires connecting their skulls. It is rotationaly symmetrical.
### Settlements
They primarily occupy the near-spherical asteroid of Hygiea, which has been built into a perfect sphere 450km across. Unlike most constructed world thought, Hygiea contains many wide open spaces and hallways that look like streets. Due to the low gravity of Hygiea, the sphere contains the largest arti-grav field, which has been known to fail occasionally. 

Hygiea is built up with hundreds of factories, workshops, research centers, and vaults storing valuable components. With their wealth, opulence, and state-of-the-art workshops House Scalerium has been engaged in a decades-long campaign of poaching skilled scientists and engineers from across the system.
### Technology
Cargo-bots deliver parcels, food, and chiefly cybernetic components along rails all across Hygiea. Advanced humanoid robots also take service jobs, but the majority are designed to embrace the technological aesthetic rather than try to mimic humans.
### Leaders
House Scalerium is lead by a structure of Directors, with the dictator referred to as High Director Zhenaro Scalerium. The High Director occupies a four meter tall robotic shell, which they claim contains no living parts. All leaders occupy the grand workshops, built within the core of Hygiea, and rarely ever leave.
