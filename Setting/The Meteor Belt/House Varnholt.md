### House Varnholt
A militant house of warlords, pirates, and mercenaries, House Varnholt controls a network of fortress-stations, hidden caches, and heavily armed warfleets. Much of their wealth comes from systematic extortion, raiding, and black market trade throughout the Belt. Originally formed in the 1900s by South American drug lords fleeing Earth as the Commonwealth cracked down on organized crime, they adapted to spacefaring life with ruthless efficiency. Over centuries, they evolved from criminals into a fully-fledged military power, one that enforces its own brutal order where the Commonwealth cannot reach.
### Insignia
House Varnholt’s insignia is a black sun, partially eclipsed by a jagged blade, set against a field of red. Variants of the symbol are often customized by individual captains, incorporating skull motifs, crossed cutlasses, or stylized warships emerging from the void.
### Settlements
House Varnholt operates from mobile strongholds—brutalist war-stations and fortified asteroid bases scattered throughout the Belt.
- **Dreadhold** - Their largest deep-space citadel, built onto the northern pole of the asteroid Ceres. Bristling with torpedo batteries and long docking arms for pirate fleets, it serves as the House’s de facto capital. Locations within include:
    - **The Maw** - A massive refueling and black market hub at the base of Dreadhold’s docking arms, where stolen goods, hostages, and mercenaries change hands.
- **Iron Wake** - A derelict Martian battlestation, now repurposed as a lawless pirate port. Orbiting opposite the sun from Ceres, it is home to the more anarchic factions of Varnholt, where rival captains settle disputes through open combat.
- **Hidden Outposts** - A network of concealed waystations, disguised as wreckage or abandoned mining platforms. These serve as fuel depots, arms caches, and fallback points for Varnholt raiding fleets.
### Leadership
House Varnholt is ruled by a war-council of the strongest captains, each commanding their own fleet or stronghold. The current Warlord Prime, Jorek Varnholt, seized power after orchestrating the assassination of his rivals in a single night. Leaders rise and fall every few years through combat or coups.

Despite their reputation as marauders, Varnholt society is built on a strict hierarchy. Each captain enforces their own code of conduct, and loyalty is expected to be absolute. Betrayal is punished by death.
