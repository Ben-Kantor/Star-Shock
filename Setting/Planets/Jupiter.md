## Jovians
Jovians are fungal colony creatures, green or brown in color. Young ones start out small, but adults are around 1-1.5m in diameter with tendrils reaching out in all directions. They evolved in the clouds of Jupiter, where various plants and other lifeforms float. They live for thousands of years, and look down on all other lifeforms. When transliterated, the Jovian language contains long words made up of vowels plus "w" and "h" sounds. Their government is called the Jovian Hierarchy, and is a hereditary absolute monarchy.

When forced to visit the surface of other planets, they live in enormous slug-like tanks, 4m tall with a curved glass sphere in front, and a long tail trailing 10m behind, all propelled by 15cm mechanical legs. Jovian spacecraft are enormous worm-like structures, some over 15km long. 
## Jovian Moons
#### Io
Ioans "Eye-oh-uns" are small furry creatures, about 1 meter tall. They are extremely tolerent of heat, and have six limbs, all of with hands. They use these to traverse their mountains and ever-shifting moon. They are valued engineers and chefs.
#### Europa
Europans are fish-like creatures, that can't survive outside of water for long. Every human who has encountered one has said they are revolting and smell horrible. They are obsessed with strategy games, many of which are incredibly complicated.
#### Ganymede
Ganymede is one of the only bodies in the system not known to have its own species, but attempts to establish a science post by the Martian Council have been blocked by Jupiter.
#### Callisto
Callistans are slim, purple, spindly humanoids. They are known to be incredibly vain, and some humans find them attractive. Their technology for growing crystals are their main point of renown. 
#### Outer Moons
The hundreds of outer moons of Jupiter are lawless region of space, many are occupied are outlaw groups, and some are even said to be occupied by a force of sentient robots. The Jovians mount constant attacks against them but are extremely hesitant to damage the moons in an effort to preserve their planetary system.
