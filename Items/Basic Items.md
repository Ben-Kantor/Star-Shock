Each character can hold up to 10 items, with multiples of small items counting as one. Some items can be used an unlimited number of times, but others are consumables. All consumables are single-use, characters can only intake at most one consumable per day, resetting every 24 hours or on a rest. Some items such as armor, weapons, or advances items will need to be added to the Items boxes on the character sheet, to indicate they are currently equipped. This includes items which don't have a range, modifier, resistance, or rate.
