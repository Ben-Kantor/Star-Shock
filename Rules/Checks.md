## Attributes
Each creature has four attributes, which are used for certain kinds of checks. These are represented with three letter abbreviations in **\[Square Brackets\]**.
- **Strength** - **\[Str\]** - Physical power, endurance, and raw force.
- **Dexterity** - **\[Dex\]** - Agility, reflexes, and precision.
- **Intellect** - **\[Int\]** - Knowledge, problem-solving, and technical skill.
- **Presence** - **\[Prs\]** - Charisma, willpower, and emotional strength.
#### Values
These can be any value, but are 1 on average for humans. PCs start with 0-3 in each totaling to 7, but NPCs can have higher or lower values (including negatives).
## Skills
Characters have a number of skills from the list below, as determined by their Backgrounds.
These are listed on their sheet under their abilities. 
Whenever they make a check that relates to one of their skills, they can add +1 to their roll.

Skills are represented by **{Single Brackets}** and categories of skills by **{{Double Brackets}}**, here and elsewhere in the game source.

## Checks
To make a check, follow these steps:
1. Roll 2d6.
2. Add your relevant attribute (Strength, Dexterity, Intellect, or Presence).
3. Add +1 if you have a relevant skill that applies to the task, check with your GM.
4. Include any bonuses or penalties applied to the situation (see below).

Then give this result to the GM, if the check was made to complete a task it is compared to a difficulty value, see [Check Difficulties](Check%20Difficulties.md) for more information about these. If the check was an attack, instead a resistances value is subtracted from it to calculate damage.
#### Bonuses and Penalties
Situational bonuses and penalties may be given given by the GM, based on the conditions of a check. When a check is made, all bonuses and penalties are totaled and added to the check.
#### Contested Checks
Sometimes two characters will roll against each other in competition, if they get the same result they both must re-roll.
#### Re-Rolling
If a character re-rolls one or both dice using an ability, they must take the new result unless they have another ability that allows them re-roll again.
## Special Outcomes
#### Criticals
If the dice show a total of 2 "snake-eyes" or 12 "boxcars" the result is a critical, and has either a failure with a setback, or a complete, easy success. This is mostly left up to the GM as to how it works.
#### Marginal Successes
If the roll misses the difficulty by exactly one, the GM can rule it as a **Marginal Success**, meaning the success is only partial or comes at some other cost.
#### Margins
For each 2 points the difficulty is exceeded by, the roll might have some other benefit or success. If the player has ideas for what this might be, they can ask.
#### Setbacks
When a check is made in a situation where success is eventually possible, a failure might indicate some other setback rather than failure in the direct task itself.
## Multiple-Character Checks
#### Cooperative Checks
If multiple characters work together to accomplish a check that could also be accomplished by one character, this system is used. Each character makes their own check, and the highest one is taken, but it takes a -1 penalty for each other roll under 10. 
#### Group Checks
If multiple people are forced to perform a check together rather than just assisting one person, each character rolls, than the average of the highest and lowest roll is rounded up or down depending on the rest of the group's rolls (GM discretion) to determine the group's score.
#### Consecutive Checks
If, after a check is failed by one character, another character wants to try, they can do so with a -1 penalty. This penalty stacks for each additional character that attempts the check.
