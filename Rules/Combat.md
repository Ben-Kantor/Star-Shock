## Initiative
When combat or another rushed encounter begins, have each character makes a **\[Dex\]** check. In order to be able to act before the enemy, characters must meet or exceed a difficulty of 10. Each character who did gets to take a turn first, in clockwise order. Then the GM takes a turn for all the enemies, and play continues around the table from them.

- Each round is considered to take ten seconds in-game.
- The order around the table alternates between clockwise and counter-clockwise.
- The GM can grant bonuses or penalties to initiative checks, depending on either side be hidden, distracted, or taking the other side by surprise.

**During each round, each player may take up to two actions, only one of which can be an attack.**
## Attacks
At the start of their turn, players declare how many actions they are taking, **up to three**.
Each action that involves a dice roll gets -1 for each action more than one that they are taking this turn. This is called the **Action Penalty**, and means if you take three actions in a turn, each one gets -2 on the roll. Actions that do not require a roll can ignore this.

Many actions will have a Rate, this is the maximum number of times you can do them per turn. You can take as many actions with a rate of 1 as you want per turn, as long as each is different.
## Attacks
Below are the basic steps to make an attack:
1. Choose and declare method of attack, usually a [weapon](/Items/Weapons.md).
2. Choose and declare a target for your attack.
3. Roll 2d6, add your attribute, skill (if any) and bonuses and penalties (if any).
4. Tell the GM, along with whether armor or resistance is used by the weapon.
5. The GM will compare your total roll to the target's armor or resistance.
6. The GM will tell you how many maneuvers you get, one for each two points you exceed the armor value by.
7. The GM may narrate the hit, and will tell you whether you have knocked the target out.
8. For each maneuver you earned, you may choose and execute it. You may not take the same maneuver more than once in the same attack.
9. Determine the amount of damage, and tell the GM.

- **Range** - "Melee" weapons can only be used to attack within the same zone, "Ranged" weapons can be used to attack farther away, with a -1 penalty for each zone/5m away the target is.
## Other Actions
Below is a list of basic actions that can be taken during a turn. This is not a complete list
- **Interact with Object** - You can usually only interact with the same object once per turn
- **Move** - Move somewhere, this can just mean running, or climbing, swimming, etc. One move action covers about 5m of ground, or one move between [Zones](./Combat.md#Zones). In more difficult terrain it might be 2.5m or less. If the movement requires difficult climbing or other skills, a **{Move}** check may be required.
- **Assist** - Offer help to a check someone else is about to make, granting them a +1 bonus if you have an attribute of three or higher or a skill relevant to the check.
- **Emergency Medicate** - Make a **\[Dex\]** + **{Medicate}** with a difficulty of 10 to heal a willing target within 1m that is not in a coma. This roll is at disadvantage unless you have a [Medical Kit](/Items/Basic%20Items.md). If successful they remove one damage point. This can allow someone who is [Unconcious](./Combat.md#Unconcious) to make a medicate check towards waking up.
- **Skill Challenges** - Working on a [Skill Challenge](/Rules/Checks.md#Multi-Turn%20Checks.md). This is usually for making repairs to a ship or something similar, and will take several turns to complete.
- **Block, Dodge, Concentrate, Meditate** - Gain a +1 bonus to one of your resistances until your next turn.
- **Use a Consumable** - Use up a [Consumable Item](/Items/Consumables), and apply it's effects to yourself or a willing target within 1m.
- **Stand up from [Prone](./Combat.md#Prone)**.
## Free Actions
Free actions are things a character can do during initiative without spending an action, and that can happen during other people's turns. You generally can't take the same Free Action multiple times during a turn cycle, unless you spend an action.
- **Free Move** - Move up to 5m, this can be split up between actions.
- **Drop [Prone](./Combat.md#Prone)** - Drop to the ground in the prone position, or stand up from it.
- **Change Items** - Put up to one item they are holding away, and then draw up to one item from their inventory.
- **Communicate** - Say something short to another character.
## Armor & Resistance
The two values of Armor and Resistance control how well you are able to resist or evade attacks.
- **Armor** represents your ability to dodge or block incoming physical attacks.
	- Base Armor = 7 + **\[Str\]** or **\[Dex\]**  *(whichever is higher)*
- **Resistance** represents your ability to cleverly avoid or overcome energy attacks and psionics.
	- Base Resistance = 7 + **\[Int\]** or **\[Prs\]**  *(whichever is higher)*

In order for an incoming attack to hit, the roll must be at least equal to your relevant value.
## Taking Damage: Consciousness Checks
When damage is dealt to a character, it is added to their previous total damage, which starts at 0. This number can be tracked in the big "Damage Taken" box on the character sheet. Then if they have seven or more total damage they must make a **consciousness check**. To do so, they roll a **\[Str\]** check against the number of damage points they have taken.
- If they succeed, nothing happens.
- If they fail, they fall unconscious.
- If they fail by 7 or more, they fall into a coma.
#### Fall damage
Consult below to see how much damage is taken from falling a certain distance. Those amounts also specify the largest downwards drop that can be made intentionally with no damage.
- Earth, Venus - 1d6 damage per 2m fallen
- Mars, anywhere with Arti-Grav - 1d6 per 5m fallen
- Large asteroids and moons - 1d6 per 10m fallen
## Status Conditions
#### Unconscious
 While a character is unconscious, if the amount of damage they have decreases, they may re-roll their consciousness check and wake up on a success. If the amount of damage increases, they must re-roll their consciousness check to see if they fall into a coma, but they don't wake up on a success. Without interference, unconscious characters will wake up after 1 hour. They can also be woken up with a successful Difficulty 10 **\[Dex\]** + **{Medicate}** check.
#### Comatose
Characters in a coma are unable to communicate and do not make consciousness checks as normal. Instead, every 24 hours, they make a coma check (a **\[Str\]** against total damage):
- If they succeed, they wake up.
- If they fail, they take one additional damage point.
- If they fail by seven or more or roll snake-eyes, and have more damage points than total XP, they die.

While in a coma, the same consumable item can't be used more than once on them, and standard heal checks do nothing. They will need advanced healing from a medical center, followed by electroshock therapy to wake them.
#### Prone
While prone, characters have a -1 penalty on attacks and some physical checks, and attacks against them have a +1 bonus. They can stand up from prone as an action.
#### Blinded
Characters who are blinded get a -1 penalty on attacks and other checks that require sight. This condition will usually be inflicted by an item or ability, and last a specified duration.
#### Others
Some other abilities will inflict other status conditions, which will always be described and have an end condition specified.
## Zone Combat
At the start of combat, the GM will describe the area in which combat is taking place, and describe how it is divided up into **Zones**. Each Zone is an area that is up to 5m in any dimension, but sometimes smaller. Movement within the same Zone is free, but moving between Zones costs one action. For the purpose of ranged weapons and such, each one zone of distance counts as 5m. If a character leaves a Zone in which there are hostile combatants, they must make a difficulty 10 **\[Dex\]** + **{Move}** check, if they fail one enemy combatant can take a free attack at them immediately with no action penalty.

Each zone can have special properties or mechanics that make combat more interesting, here are some options:
- Slippery - Each time a character in this zone takes damage they must make a difficulty 8 dexterity check or fall prone.
- Elevated - Ranged attacks down from this zone have a +1 bonus.
## Map Combat *(Variant)*
For some complex encounters, the GM may decide to setup a map instead of zones. The recommended way to do this is having a printed out or drawn map, and to use small markers. A virtual table-top can also be used, we recommend [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/). While doing combat on a map, squares or hexes may be used, each of which represents 1m. Characters have a pool of movement that starts at 5m, which they can use to move during their turn. By spending an action, they can gain an additional 5m of movement.
