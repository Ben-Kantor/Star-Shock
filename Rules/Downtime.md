## Shifts
In non-urgent situations, the game progresses in 4-hour intervals called **Shifts**. During each Shift, players take turns deciding what their characters do and resolving those actions mechanically. Below are some ways a shift can be spent.
#### Resting
Characters can rest requiring one ration per character. A successful rest reduces the character’s damage to half (round down).
#### Performing a Medicate Check
A character trained in medicine can make an **\[Dex\]** + **{Medicate}** check of difficulty 10, if they have necessary supplies. On success, one character currently resting can heal down to 1/3 damage instead of 1/2 (round down as usual). 
#### Crafting
Players can craft items, gadgets, or weapons if they have the necessary materials and skills.
#### Ship Modification
Characters with technical expertise can perform modifications or repairs on the ship, upgrading its capabilities or fixing damage.
#### Spending XP
Characters can allocate experience points to improve skills, abilities, or attributes.
#### Research or Study
Study a text or other resource, either a small one or some part of a large one. Or make a request to a [Comm-Library](/Setting/Technology.md#Comm-Libraries) and study the results.
#### Keeping Watch
Make **\[Prs\]** + **{Recon}** / **{Comms}** check to keep watch for stealthy or cloaked activity.
#### Earning Money
Characters can find temporary work. A skill check determines how much they earn during the Shift (Tsi equal to their roll).
#### Trade
Buying and selling goods in the marketplace. No more than one significant transaction is allowed per Shift.
#### Carousing
Socializing, gathering rumors, or building connections with the locals.
#### Gambling
Choose an amount of money to gamble, then make a check to see how much you lose/gain. Can also be modeled by a mini-game if several people characters go together.
## Spending Days
When the party spends several days in a population center or travels aboard a ship, the game can transition to a broader timescale. Each **day** represents a full cycle of activity and rest, during which every character can:
- Complete up to three Shifts’ worth of activities.
- Spend time on recreation or leisure.
- Get a full rest, halving damage as usual.

To run this, go around the table asking each player what their character does during each of the three shifts in a day, then bring the characters together during the night and offer opportunities for roleplay. This system provides flexibility, allowing detailed play during key moments and efficient pacing during extended downtime.
## Buying & Selling
#### Finding a Merchant
For common items, finding a merchant is relatively easy in most locations. However, only certain rare items will be available in any given location. Player can choose to look for "any rare item."
- **Quick Purchase:** Players can buy an item at its base price without spending a Shift.
- **Bartering:** Bartering for better prices usually takes an entire Shift.
#### Bargaining
When a merchant offers an item, they start with an initial price (typically the item’s base value). Players may counteroffer, then make a **\[Prs\]** + **{Negotiate}** check to negotiate the price, with a difficulty depending on how steep the offer is. On a success that price is met, on a failure a compromise is offered or the offer is rejected.
#### Selling an Item
When selling an item, the default price is half the item’s base value, but this can be increased through successful bartering.
#### Restricted Items
If trying to buy or sell an illicit item, a **\[Prs\]** + **{Streetwise}** check is needed to find someone to trade with, or another challenge set by the GM. Then starting prices are doubled and buy values are halved. If you have permission to trade in the goods, finding a legal buyer may still require some effort.
