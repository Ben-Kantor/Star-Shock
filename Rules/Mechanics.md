## Luck Points
At the start of each session, each player gains 1d6 luck points, up to a maximum of 7. Players can then donate luck points to other who have fewer than them, but in-game currency cannot be traded for these, as the points belong to the players not the characters. The GM may also grant luck points as a bonus.

There are two ways to spend Luck Points:
- One luck point can be spent to reroll any d6 as part 
- Before making an action, a player may spend a luck point to ignore one point of action penalty, this is most useful when a character needs to take more actions then planned.

If a player really wants, they can use unspent XP instead of Luck Points, however this should be saved for desperate situations. This ability offers the characters an inherent advantage for being the protagonists of the story, as no NPCs have luck points.
## Contacts
Contacts are NPCs that a player character has a connection to, providing support or access to specific resources. Players can note any NPC they meet as a contact, provided they ask their name and establish a way to contact them in the future.
#### Trust Levels
Contacts have four levels of trust, which increase as the PCs build rapport with them. These levels are visually represented by diamonds (◇◇◇), filled in as trust grows.
- **◇◇◇** - **Acquaintance:** You know this person, and they’re open to small deals or basic interactions, but they won’t take risks for you.
- **◆◇◇** - **Familiar Contact:** The contact has had positive experiences with you. They’re willing to take minor risks, share useful information, or engage in larger deals.
- **◆◆◇** - **Trusted Ally:** A strong and reliable relationship has formed. The contact trusts you, takes significant risks, and may share sensitive resources or information.
- **◆◆◆** - **Loyal Partner:** The bond is deep, built on loyalty or shared interests. The contact will prioritize your needs, take substantial risks, and provide critical aid when necessary.
#### Building and Losing Trust
A contact’s trust level can increase at most once per session, provided the players make a significant, positive interaction or deal with the contact. Small, routine interactions won't improve trust if the contact already has a high level of trust.

Trust can drop if players:
- Call in a significant favor without repayment.
- Fail to deliver on promises or deals.
- Lie to, betray, or endanger the contact.
